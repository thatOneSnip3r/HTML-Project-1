    <p>
        So you want to figure out how to make a Google account? It's actually really simple.
        The creation website is quite straightforward, but let me be the one to teach you!

    </p>
    <h3>Required Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Click <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp"
                target="_blank">here</a> to go to the account creation page.</li>
        <li>Fill out the boxes that show up. <br><img src="assets/account_creation.jpg"
                alt="there should be an image here. What happened?" width="500">
                <!-- Source: my screenshot from Google -->
            <br>It should ask you for:
            <br> -Your First and Last name
            <br> -An email with the name you choose
            <br> -A password that you can make up
            <br> Afer this, you will be taken to a follow up page.
        </li>
        <li>Next, it will ask you for:
            <br> -Your phone number (<strong>optional</strong>)
            <br> -A backup email (<strong>optional</strong>)
            <br> -Your birthday
            <br> -Your preferred gender
            <br><img src="assets/account_creation_2.jpg" alt="there should be an image here. What happened?"
                width="500">
                <!-- Source: my screenshot from Google -->
            <br> Remember: Your phone number and backup email are only optional, you don't <em>need</em> them to create
            your accout.
        </li>
        <li> Finally, you should be taken to a Terms & Services page. <em> Read it if you want, but it really doesn't
                even matter
                at this point because Google already has your personal info somehow</em>.</li>
            <br><img src="assets/terms_n_services.jpg" alt="here should be an image here. What happened?" width="600">
            <!-- Source: my screenshot from Google -->
            <br> Press <strong>"I Agree"</strong> and there you go! You've now made your very own Google account. Nice job!</li>
    </ol>
