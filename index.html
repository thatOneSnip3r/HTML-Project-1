        find out!

    <h3>Required Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open up <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">google.com</a>.</li>
        <li>Make sure you have a Google account and are signed into it. <br> <a href="google_account.html"
                target="_blank">
                Don't have one? Click here!</a></li>
        <li>Here is an image of what the Google homepage looks like: <br><img src="assets/google_home_page.png"
                alt="there should be an image here. What's wrong?" width="500"><br>Notice the circled icon in the top
            right of the screen
            that looks like this: <br><img src="assets/icon_grid.png" alt="there should be an image here. What's wrong?"
                width="20"><br>Click on that icon.</li>
        <!-- Source: my screenshot from Google -->
        <!-- Source: https://thenounproject.com/term/grid-menu/260459/ -->
        <li>Scroll until you get to the Google Drive image that looks like this: <img src="assets/drive_logo.png"
                alt="there should be an image here. What's wrong?" width="25">.</li>
        <!-- Source: http://free.arinco.org/storage/gdrive/ -->
        <li>You should be brought to a page with the word "Drive" in the top left of the screen, as well as a bar on
            the left side of the screen. Here's a picture of what a drive looks like, although yours might be empty.
            <br><img src="assets/drive_screen.jpg" width="500">
        </li>
        <!-- Source: my screenshot from Google -->
        <li>If you look at the image above, you'll notice a box that looks like this: <br><img src="assets/new_icon.jpg"
                alt="there should be an image here. What's wrong?" width="100"><br> Click on that and a bar that looks
            like this: <br><img src="assets/file_dropdown.png" alt="there should be an image here. What's wrong?"
                width="200"><br>
            Next, click on the words that say Google Docs.
        </li>
        <!-- Sources: my screenshot from Google -->
        <li>
            After doing this you should be brought to an empty word document that should look like this: <br><img
                src="assets/empty_doc.jpg" alt="there should be an image here. What's wrong?" width="500"><br>And
            congrats! You successfully created a Google Doc!
